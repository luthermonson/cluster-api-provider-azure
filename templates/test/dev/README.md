# capz developer test templates

The template yaml specs in this directory are intended for aiding and accelerating capz and/or upstream Kubernetes feature development.

The set of cluster configurations in `/templates/test/dev/` do not necessarily reflect production-ready cluster configurations. For a set of cluster configurations that are regularly tested against production scenarios, see the template yaml specs under `/templates/test/ci/`.
